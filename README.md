# Syrian Meals
+ Syrian Meals is a website for a family-run small business that sells homemade Syrian meals in Hamburg, Germany, which will be sought by people who enjoy eating both quite delicious and quite healthy food. Syrian Meals will be useful to those people as it markets its meals through this site and its links to the relevant social media, which, in turn, makes it feasible for its customers to order their prized meals by phone or email.
+ I developed Syrian Meals as my portfolio project 1 of my full stack software development diploma with the Code Institute in Dublin, Ireland.

+ This section appears on the top right of the home page and informs a user that "Syrian Meals" is a Syrian, family-run, small business that sells home-cooked, Syrian meals in Hamburg by implementing Syrian cuisine and using only bio ingredients. Those three characteristics emphasize to a user that this small business aims to produce meals of very high quality that is quite healthy and tasty. The fact that the small business is Syrian demonstrates that the meals not only follow the Syrian cuisine meals but also are being made by Syrians, whose nutrition system stands the test of time for thousands of years.
+ The second paragraph explains to a user how he can order a meal; it says that a user can order by phone or email, which are inserted on the contact page, at least one day in advance, which, again, foregrounds that a meal quality is a dominant feature as meals will always be fresh on the day of eating.

+ The header of the contact form, "You Are What You Eat!" spotlights to the user what "Syrian Meals" is all about.

## 6. 4. GitHub
+ A platform for version control and collaborative software development, which I exploited to create a central code repository for and deploy the Syrian Meals website; this, in turn, allows me to keep track of changes made to code and revert to previous versions if needed.
## 6. 5. Balsamiq
+ This is the program I applied to generate the frameworks of the Syrian Meals website.
